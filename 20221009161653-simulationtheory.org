* Disproof
"The Kybalion", written by the "Three Initiates" and published in january of 1912, drisproves the theory that our Universe is a simulation on logical grounds. The bulk of the proof is in chapters 4 and 5. The model explained in the book, which cannot be named, but which we could refer to as Hermetic Mystery, is much more empowering than simluation theory.
