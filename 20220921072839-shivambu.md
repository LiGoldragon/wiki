# Damar Tantra
Shivambu (auto- urine) is heavenly nectar, which is capable of destroying senility and diseases. The practitioner of Yoga should take it before proceeding with his other rituals.
After cleansing the mouth, and performing the other essential morning functions, one should drink one’s own clear urine, which is the annihilator of senility and diseases.
One who drinks Shivambu for the duration of a month will be purified internally. Drinking it for two months stimulates and energizes the senses.
Drinking it for three months destroys all diseases and frees one from all troubles. By drinking it for five months, one acquires divine vision and freedom from all diseases.
Continuation of the practice for six months makes the practitioner highly intelligent and proficient in the scriptures, and if the duration is seven months, the practitioner acquires extraordinary strength.
If the practice is continued for eight months, one acquires a permanent glow like that of gold, and if it is continued for nine months, one is freed from tuberculosis and leprosy.
Ten months of this practice makes one a veritable treasury of luster. Eleven months of it would purify all the organs of the body.
A man who has continued the practice for a year becomes the equal of the sun in radiance. He who has continued for two years conquers the element Earth.
If the practice is continued for three years, one conquers the element of Water, and if it is continued for four years, the element Light is also conquered.
He who continues the practice for five years conquers the element Air, and he who continues it for seven years conquers pride.
Continuation of the practice for eight years enables one to conquer all the important elements of Nature, and continuation of it for nine years frees one from the cycle of birth and death.
One who has continued the practice for ten years can fly through the air without effort. One who has continued it for eleven years is able to hear the voice of his sour (inner self)
He who has continued the practice for twelve years will live so long as the moon and the stars last. He is not troubled by dangerous animals such as snakes, and no poisons can kill him. He cannot be consumed by fire, and can float on water just like wood.

## Reduced Shivambu

Śivambu must first be taken in an earthen vessel and kept. When only a quarter of it is left, the cold concentrate should be used to massage the body.
There are certain mantras that need to be recited while accepting, drinking and harvesting, which I now bring to your attention.
While you take Śivambu in your hands, this mantra should be recited: “Aum Hrim Klim Bhairavaya Namaha.” (This mantra must be recited while you drink it.)
“Aum Shrim Klim Uddamareshwaraaya Namaha.” (It must be recited while urinating.)
“Aum Sarvashristiprabhave Rudraaya Namaha.” Having thus taken Śivambu, the yogi should apply it to the body, an action that abundantly nourishes the limbs and heals all disorders.
The yogi who follows these instructions reaches preeminence among all the yogis and his movements become totally unrestricted. He acquires the power of a thousand elephants and is able to get (and digest) any food he wants.
The one who uses the urine that has not been swept up according to the instructions for massaging the body, finds that his disorders worsen and all his limbs become weakened due to the loss of muscle tone.
Therefore, urine that has not been matured or aged should never be used to massage the body.
On the other hand, O Goddess, if for this purpose properly matured urine is used, all achievements are at hand.
