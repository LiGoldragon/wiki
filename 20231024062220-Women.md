# Sexuality
Women, more so than men, are the true supporters of the social order, and to fulfill this role, they have been reared uniformly the world over to be at the service of men. It makes no difference whether women are bought right off the slave block, or if they are courted and loved, their fundamental purpose and fate is still the same: to nourish, shelter and serve men. The diabolical part of women's servile position is that it doesn't appear to be merely a social prescription, but a fundamental biological imperative.

Every species has a biological imperative to perpetuate itself, and nature has provided tools in order to ensure that the merging of female and male energies takes place in the most efficient way. In the human realm, although the primary function of sexual intercourse is procreation, it also has a secondary and covert function, which is to ensure a continual flow of energy from women to men. 

Men leave specific energy lines inside the body of women. They are like luminous tapeworms that move inside the womb, sipping up energy. The energy lines are put there to ensure that a steady supply of energy reaches the man who deposited them. Those lines of energy, established through sexual intercourse, collect and steal energy from the female body to benefit the male who left them there.

Nature's imperative is to perpetuate our species. In order to ensure that this continues to take place, women have to carry an excessive burden at their basic energy level, and that means a flow of energy that taxes women.

Women are the foundation for perpetuating the human species. The bulk of the energy comes from them, not only to gestate, give birth and nourish their offspring, but also to ensure that the male plays his part in this whole process. Ideally this process ensures that a woman feeds her man energetically through the filaments he left inside her body, so that the man becomes mysteriously dependent on her at an ethereal level. This is expressed in the overt behavior of the man returning to the same woman again and again to maintain his source of sustenance. That way, nature ensures that men, in addition to their immediate drive for sexual gratification, set up more permanent bonds with women. These energy fibers left in women's wombs also become merged with the energy makeup of the offspring, should conception take place. It may be the rudiments of family ties, for the energy from the father merges with that of the fetus, and enables the man to sense that the child is his own. These are some of the facts of life a girl's mother never tells her. Women are reared to be easily seduced by men, without the slightest idea of the consequences of sexual intercourse in terms of the energy drainage it produces in them.

It's bad enough that one man leaves energy lines inside a woman's body, although that is necessary for having offspring and ensuring their survival. But to have the energy lines of ten or twenty men inside her feeding off her luminosity is more than anyone can bear. No wonder women can never lift up their heads.

A woman carries those luminous worms for seven years, after which time they disappear or fade out. But the wretched part is that when the seven years are about to be up, the whole army of worms, from the very first man a woman had to the very last one, all become agitated at once so that the woman is driven to have sexual intercourse again. Then all the worms spring to life stronger than ever to feed off the woman's luminous energy for another seven years. 

The worms die out if she can resist having sex for seven years. But it's nearly impossible for a woman to remain celibate like that in our day and age, unless she becomes a nun, or has money to support herself. And even then she still would need a totally different rationale. Because not only is it a biological imperative that women have sexual intercourse, but it is also a social mandate.

Since we are unable to see the flow of energy, we may be needlessly perpetuating patterns of behavior or emotional interpretations associated with this unseen flow of energy. For instance, for society to demand that women marry or at least offer themselves to men is wrong, as it is wrong for women to feel unfulfilled unless they have a man's semen inside them. It is true that a man's energy lines give women purpose; make them fulfill their biological destinies of feeding men and their offspring. But human beings are intelligent enough to demand of themselves more than merely the fulfillment of the reproduction imperative. For example, to evolve is an equal if not a greater imperative than to reproduce; and, in this case, evolving entails the awakening of women to their true role in the energetic scheme of reproduction.

Today the average woman has been reared, like every other woman, by a mother who raised her to find a suitable husband so she would not have the stigma of being a spinster. She was really bred, like an animal, to have sex, no matter what her mother chose to call it. She, like every other woman, has been tricked and forced into submission, and the sad part is that she is trapped in this pattern, even if she doesn't intend to procreate.
