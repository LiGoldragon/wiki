# Purva Bhadrapada
Purva Bhadra
20° Aquarius - 3°20’ Pisces

Lord Hanuman is said to have been born in this Heaven. Purva Bhadra is extremely intelligent and yet an unbiased, simple and peace-loving energy.

The faith in God is complete in this Heaven. All that is supernatural is of great interest to the natives of this Heaven. The pure heart emerging from this Heaven enables access to the ethereal dimensions of life more than to the mundane. The character of Purva Bhadra is one of bona fide. The natives are generally of good reputation. They cherish speaking the truth and try to be truthful. They distance themselves from cheap tricks of manipulation and dishonesty. They are optimistic and always benevolent and helpful to others. Friendliness, love and affection are their natural qualities. They pour their heart’s energies into every work that they do; they are not careless or inattentive.

They do well in spirituality. They are fairly good in studies relating to astrology, astronomy, occult sciences and normal sciences. In terms of earning money and living in society, they believe in simplicity and are honourable. They prefer to be self-employed, for they do not find a boss or a superior virtuous enough to serve.

Purva Bhadra is a protective Heaven. It gives an anterior protection and anterior shelter, while Uttara Bhadra gives a posterior shelter and protection.

An anterior shelter is a protection that is ahead of you. It means, the natives of this Heaven offer shelter and protection to those who follow them. Lord Hanuman was always moving ahead of Lord Rama to ensure complete protection to Lakshmana and Sita. In fact, Hanuman is an embodiment of protection for all those who worship him. The beauty of Purva Bhadra is that it is ruled by Jupiter, the preceptor and also the Lord. Thursdays are very propitious to the natives of this Heaven.

The cosmic deity of this Heaven is Lord Shiva, who constitutes the Jupiter for the universe. The seer is Agastya, who is an embodiment of Lord Shiva.

The single-horned unicorn, the one-footed serpent (the serpent of Kundalini), the unitary symbol Shiva Lingam (Ekapada), who is also called the unborn one (Aja), are but symbols relating to Purva Bhadra.

The worship of Shiva or Hanuman enables the natives of Purva Bhadra to ensure auspiciousness ahead of them. Purva Bhadra natives are also considered to be lucky-footed ones. It is but natural that when a Sadguru (seer) or Lord Shiva or Hanuman step in, things turn out to be auspicious. The number relating to Purva Bhadra is 7, the colour is golden yellow or silver grey, the gemstone is a yellow sapphire, the favourable number is 3, the fruit is mango, the tree is neem, the element is ether, the bird is a peacock, and the animal is a lion.

Jupiter being the presiding deity and planet, education, intelligence, wealth, expansion are but very common for the natives of Purva Bhadra. Their knowledge precedes their wealth. Their preference is also more towards knowledge than towards wealth.

Since they are ruled by Ekapada, the single-footed deity, they would eventually be raised by a single parent. In the human body they represent the right brain as also the thighs and the legs.

The natives of Purva Bhadra are well balanced in their abstract thinking and practical working. Purva Bhadra natives mature in all dimensions of life earlier than their age. Since they are sky loving ones, they do not hold a permanent abode on Earth. They keep moving. They learn sciences and practice them. They are intuitive and goodwill-oriented. Being Jupiterians, they are good orators and also have sound sleep. They are adventurous and brave individuals and are driven by the purpose. They love mysticism and occult practices.

The Purva Bhadra natives are medium sized and have broad cheeks and fleshy lips. They look simple.

They are principled and therefore suffer mentally.

They care not for their attire. They also care not for blind beliefs. They are respected and honoured in the society. They love food. They have smiling eyes and pleasing personality. They evolve their own program of self-development and do not carry the sheep-like mentality. They approach life with freshness along with the support of knowledge. The daylily plant represents their vibrant, fresh and powerful personality.
