# Basics

## Solar (Tropical) vs Arbitrarilly Fixed (Sidereal)

The constellations were named after the Zodiac. The Zodiac and Nakshatras were defined by the Solar cycle by our most ancient sources. Astrology speaks most clearly, and is founded on, latitudinal movements/aspects. Ref: Ptolemy, Tetrabiblios - Surya Siddhanta - E. Burgess

### The Zodiac as the Universal Matrix

#### Aries

Aries represents the constant emergence of unconscious contents into the structures of the ego-consciousness, the eternal Advent of inspiration, of God into man, of the universal into the particular, of collective memories into the individual, of instinctual urges into personal realizations.

#### Scorpio

These human depths, which are to be made significant by the individual experiencing them lucidly and without illusion, are the regions to which we refer loosely and generally under the name of sex.

#### Sagittarius
Sagittarius, being a Fire sign, is a transforming energy. Being also a "mutable" or "common" sign, it is energy moving in a spirallic rhythm. Sagittarius is an ideological energy. It is the energy inherent in ideas and in complex systems of ideas. It is the energy of a mind which organizes into definite and creative mental formulations the results of the experience gathered through the Libra and Scorpio phases. Sagittarius is the symbol of the civilizing and the abstract mind. While Gemini organizes the concrete data produced by sensations and all environmental factors, Sagittarius always attempts to build systems, generalizations, laws which take in as great a field as possible. Thus the expansive nature of the sign, which is ruled by Jupiter, the principle of expansion in all forms. Sagittarius attempts to include always more facts, to formulate ever simpler and more encompassing laws, to integrate an ever greater number of greater people, of groups, of nations in larger federative systems, in more ultimate syntheses. By so doing, however, it may overreach its goal and lose contact with concrete realities. Sagittarius intuitions are rooted in the identification of the individual with vast social currents and human needs. They are not as mysterious and god-like as those produced by Aries energy, or as proudly personal and obstinate as those which arise in Leo, but they are so encompassing and they appear to be so ultimate that one cannot get sufficiently far from them to get a true perspective on their actual validity. They dazzle the imagination by their scope and silence objections by their apparent logic or reasonableness. Perfect systems may be built from them; yet the formal perfection may hide the fact that they do not actually fit the practical realities or needs of the immediate situation.


### The Astrology of Personality 

Astrology is fundamentally the algebra of life.
Its applications are as numerous as the types of life it co-ordinates, integrates, and to which it gives the significance of Order.

Evil is due to the fact that the respective spheres of man and of the universe become mixed, as man ceases to be a mere part of universal nature and becomes in his own right a cosmic whole.
