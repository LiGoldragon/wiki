# Basics
## Solar (Tropical) vs Arbitrarilly Fixed (Sidereal)
The constellations were named after the Zodiac. The Zodiac and Nakshatras were defined by the Solar cycle by our most ancient sources. Astrology speaks most clearly, and is founded on, latitudinal movements/aspects. Ref: Ptolemy, Tetrabiblios - Surya Siddhanta - E. Burgess

## Dane Rudhyar
### The Zodiac as the Universal Matrix
#### Aries
Aries represents the constant emergence of unconscious contents into the structures of the ego-consciousness, the eternal Advent of inspiration, of God into man, of the universal into the particular, of collective memories into the individual, of instinctual urges into personal realizations.

#### Scorpio
These human depths, which are to be made significant by the individual experiencing them lucidly and without illusion, are the regions to which we refer loosely and generally under the name of sex.
