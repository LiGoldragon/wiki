# Basics

## Solar (Tropical) vs Arbitrarilly Fixed (Sidereal)

The constellations were named after the Zodiac. The Zodiac and Nakshatras were defined by the Solar cycle by our most ancient sources. Astrology speaks most clearly, and is founded on, latitudinal movements/aspects. Ref: Ptolemy, Tetrabiblios - Surya Siddhanta - E. Burgess

## Dane Rudhyar

### The Zodiac as the Universal Matrix

#### Aries

Aries represents the constant emergence of unconscious contents into the structures of the ego-consciousness, the eternal Advent of inspiration, of God into man, of the universal into the particular, of collective memories into the individual, of instinctual urges into personal realizations.

#### Scorpio

These human depths, which are to be made significant by the individual experiencing them lucidly and without illusion, are the regions to which we refer loosely and generally under the name of sex.

### The Astrology of Personality 

Astrology is fundamentally the algebra of life.
Its applications are as numerous as the types of life it co-ordinates, integrates, and to which it gives the significance of Order.

Evil is due to the fact that the respective spheres of man and of the universe become mixed, as man ceases to be a mere part of universal nature and becomes in his own right a cosmic whole.
