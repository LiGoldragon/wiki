* Notes
** On the utility of elisp
The elisp ecosystem's greatest utility is in
translating/upgrading the useful libraries to sajban, even if they
only yield templates; elisp is, after all, /a lisp/, and is therefore
easy to read for translation.

** imenu
Below is a simple example that can be used in shell mode buffers, to index environment variables assignments.
#+begin_src elisp
(setq imenu-generic-expression '((nil "^\\([A-Z_]+\\)=.*" 1)))
#+end_src
