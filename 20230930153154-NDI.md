NDI Related Network Ports and Protocols for firewall 

Reliable UDP
This is a new high-performance approach to transferring video and audio on a network. Real world testing has shown that in many problematic network configurations that performed poorly with previous versions of NDI and other video protocols now work perfectly with this version.

This uses a highly optimized UDP sender that supports very high latency connections (e.g., WAN or WiFi networks), with state-of-the-art congestion control and loss recovery (far superior to other reliable transfer protocols used in the industry), full inter-stream bandwidth management and connection sharing, no front of line queue blocking, reduced number of open ports and fully asynchronous sending and receiving.

Multipath TCP
This protocol permits transport across multiple NICs and all network paths, it is ensigned to use hardware-accelerated network adapters with adaptive bandwidth sharing across NICs.

Multipath TCP helps to maximize throughput, resource usage, and increase redundancy across the network, and is not disrupted by adding or dropping pathways and works across multiple network types such as wireless and mobile.

Single TCP
This is a network communications protocol, which enables two host systems to establish a connection and exchange data packets, and ensures data is delivered intact to the correct destination. TCP is typically grouped with IP (Internet Protocol) and known collectively as TCP/IP.

UDP with Forward Error Correction
This is an alternative protocol to TCP that is used when reliable delivery of data packets in not required. UDP is typically used for applications where timeliness is of higher priority than accuracy, such as streaming media, teleconferencing, and voice-over-IP (VoIP). Forward error correction (FEC) is a method of obtaining error control in data transmission in which the source (transmitter) sends redundant data and the destination (receiver).

NDI utilized this network ports 

Port number	Type	Use
5353	UDP	This is the standard port used for mDNS communication and is always used for multicast sending of the current sources onto the network.
5959	TCP	NDI Discovery Server is an optional method to have NDI devices perform discovery. This can be beneficial in large configurations, when you need to connect NDI devices between subnets or if mDNS is blocked.
5960	TCP	This is a TCP port used for remote sources to query this machine and discover all of the sources running on it. This is used for instance when a machine is added by an IP address in the access manager so that from an IP address alone all of the sources currently running on that machine can be discovered automatically.
5961 and up	TCP	These are the base TCP connections used for each NDI stream. For each current connection, at least one port number will be used in this range.
5960 and up	UDP	In version 5 and above, when using reliable UDP connections it will use a very small number of ports in the range of 5960 for UDP. These port numbers are shared with the TCP connections. Because connection sharing is used in this mode, the number of ports required is very limited and only one port is needed per NDI process running and not one port per NDI connection.
6960 and up	TCP/UDP	When using multi-TCP or UDP receiving, at least one port number in this range will be used for each connection.
7960 and up	TCP/UDP	When using multi-TCP, unicast UDP, or multicast UDP sending, at least one port number in this range will be used for each connection.
Ephemeral	TCP	Legacy to NDI v1 - The current versions (4.6 and later) no longer use any ports in the ephemeral port range.
