## Pisces
Pisces is the sign of "social" feelings and the symbol of time fulfilled. Here the cycle ends, but the end can be the foundation for a new beginning and the new departure in Aries must naturally come out of something. This "something" is the seed, the Last Day of the preceding cycle Pisces, the prae-germinal or prenatal stage of all types of New Life, the act of stepping over the threshold of the New Life.

The essential characteristic of truly social feelings and the signature of "time fulfilled" can be summed up in one word:

Compassion. Compassion is the one social feeling. It is the law of the seed, the law of sacrifice. Abstractly speaking, to have compassion is to "encompass" more and more, to be a circle whose circumference includes all that can be experienced and leaves out or scorns nothing.

In Pisces global humanity becomes a fact of consciousness for the individual. Pisces is the home of global humanity. It is the great Sea in which all separate continents feel at home.

Pisces is not a cogitating or thought-creative sign. It is a pulsating womb, gathering in social experience and synthesizing the past of a people and a culture — only to release the things gathered with a new polarization, as the Aries urge compels delivery.

Pisces is "time fulfilled" — the end of the gestation period. Time ceases, only to be born anew with the first cry of the baby. Everything comes to a conclusion and to a pause. The old disintegrates, the new is yet unborn; but in that moment of transition life operates, as it were, in an out-of-gear condition. In this, there is freedom.
