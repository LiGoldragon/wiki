### Conjunct Jupiter
At this time, a person has substantial control over his financial
activities and philosophies.  His general attitude is well balanced by
his desires and proper circumstantial support.  Here, what one
wants to do with his resources may not be what the circumstances want
him to do. As a result, some tensions and frustrations are seen
within that individual. Basically, this turns out to be an excellent
decision in the long run as long as the individual does not fight too
vigorously with the ci rcumstances.  If at this point, one is highly
tempted to use and spread his resources, the actual loss can become a
gain in terms of philosophical understandings. In many cases, sudden
freeze on financial activities is noticed.  The purpose of it is to
find how one deals with such circumstances in a logical way. Please
note that this is a good aspect and the circumstantial intensions are
to your advantage.  Deep-rooted philosophies from past life often get
re-engraved, reshaped or reinforced at this time.  Watch your weig ht
and diet under this critical aspect as physical expansion is very
easy now.

#### Moon
This aspect provides great internal emotional satisfaction for these people.  If not, at least they will provide such satisfaction for others.  Basically, this aspect represents better emotional distribution within or without the individual.  Support from mother or 'mother-figure' is of utmost significance for them in this life.  The idea of take something from "mother" and be a "mother-figure" to someone is highly under focus. These people go through ultra high and low emotional stages in this category. As a result, it is best not to provoke them emotionally at the wrong time.  Vivid imagination and stronger sensitivity towards some of the past-life experiences and their illumination is noticed in this aspect. They may go through typical or unusual emotional experiences which could be a part of their recent life externalization with a great similarity to reality.
