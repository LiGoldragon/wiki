 ## Gospels
your springs overflow in the streets, your streams of water in the public squares?
Let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers.
May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth.
A loving doe, a graceful deer— may her breasts satisfy you always, may you ever be intoxicated with her love.
Why, my son, be intoxicated with another man’s wife?  Why embrace the bosom of a wayward woman?
(Proverbs 5:15-20)


## Damar Tantra
After getting out of bed, the face and the mouth should be washed with water. Afterwards one should drink one’s Water of Shiva quite willingly and cheerfully. All the ailments subject to from the very birth will be completely cured. If this method is followed for one month, one’s body will be internally cleansed. Drinking it for two months stimulates and energises the senses.  If this method is followed for three months, all types of ailments will disappear and all miseries will evaporate. After following this method for five months, the follower will be completely healthy and will be bestowed with divine eyesight.  After six months of following this therapy, the follower will be exceptionally intelligent. After seven months, the follower will be extraordinarily strong.  After eight months the human body will possess divine lustre like that of shining gold which will be permanent. After nine months of continual use, tuberculosis and leprosy will perish.  After ten months of continued use, the follower becomes practically the treasury of lustre and brightness. After eleven months the follower becomes pure, both externally and internally.  After one year of continued use, the follower acquires solar shining.
(Damar Tantra - Verse 10-16)

## Papyrus Translation (Bartnett & Adelman)
The Water of Life is given to you, drink it and wash your body with it.
It is given to you for your spirit, mind, and body - for the man and woman inside you.
The Water of Life is given to us to make us whole - oneness in ourselves.
It increases the ability of the hidden senses. It gives one courage, strength and freedom - freedom from fears and attachments.
The Water of Life will enable men and women to live as one - in this world and in the world to come, making both worlds into one place.
The Water of Life will create a civilization far superior to the one existing. Noble character traits will be it's sign.
This civilization will guide the sciences and the arts - it will guide the spirit, mind, and body for further growth and increased wisdom.
It will give birth to the unity of both worlds.
The Water of Life will increase your love and knowledge - it makes you more whole.
It will help you to be what you are - a perfect creation.
Isis, the servant of mankind and mediatior of the idea of creation, is giving the key of higher living.
With spirit, mind, and body, we have to guide men and women with wisdom similar to that of a priest, teaching the Water of Life and the life principles - for this world and the world to come.
