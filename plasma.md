 ## Gospels
your springs overflow in the streets, your streams of water in the public squares?
Let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers.
May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth.
A loving doe, a graceful deer— may her breasts satisfy you always, may you ever be intoxicated with her love.
Why, my son, be intoxicated with another man’s wife?  Why embrace the bosom of a wayward woman?
(Proverbs 5:15-20)


## Damar Tantra
After getting out of bed, the face and the mouth should be washed with water. Afterwards one should drink one’s Water of Shiva quite willingly and cheerfully. All the ailments subject to from the very birth will be completely cured. If this method is followed for one month, one’s body will be internally cleansed. Drinking it for two months stimulates and energises the senses.  If this method is followed for three months, all types of ailments will disappear and all miseries will evaporate. After following this method for five months, the follower will be completely healthy and will be bestowed with divine eyesight.  After six months of following this therapy, the follower will be exceptionally intelligent. After seven months, the follower will be extraordinarily strong.  After eight months the human body will possess divine lustre like that of shining gold which will be permanent. After nine months of continual use, tuberculosis and leprosy will perish.  After ten months of continued use, the follower becomes practically the treasury of lustre and brightness. After eleven months the follower becomes pure, both externally and internally.  After one year of continued use, the follower acquires solar shining.
(Damar Tantra - Verse 10-16)
