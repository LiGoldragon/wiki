# Zodiac as Universal Matrix - Rudhyar
Aquarius is the last of the Air signs of the zodiac, and as such it has a deep relationship with the two previous members of the Air trinity, Gemini and Libra. Following the pattern of analysis which we have used previously, we will therefore conclude that Aquarius is a synthesis of the mental energies which are developed in Gemini and Libra and that it also represents the factor of "depth" in human experience (Air operating it the Fixed mode). The natural type of thinking developed in Gemini becomes correlated and integrated with the individual type of mind flourishing in Libra, and the social mentality of Aquarius emerges out of the synthesis.

From what has been said in the previous studies on the signs Sagittarius and especially Capricorn, the reader should be aware of the full implications of the term "social." Obviously it is not used here in the popular, newspaper meaning of the "social set," "high society"

and so on. When we speak of social values and social ideals we speak of values and ideals which are born out of the living-together, the feeling-together, the thinking-together of many human beings (or groups of human beings) who are more or less permanently related to one another. Social values are values which are held in common for a definite length of time by many individuals. They are held in common; those who hold them are (theoretically at least)

individuals. Social values are therefore a synthesis of both common factors (in human nature, in a genetic type or in a special culture) and individual factors — those of Gemini and Libra.

At the Gemini stage of development, the human being has not yet quite reached the stage of full individualization.(1) This is so because every cycle of human development can be considered as starting from the common Root of "human nature" or from some new modification of this common nature. Aries represents the starting point of the new cycle. In Aries, human nature speaks its will through the human organism. Everything is essentially action, projection, initiative. The New Factor in human nature is revealed. Aries is Revelation — it is the ever-repeated Advent. In Taurus, the New Factor becomes substantial; human nature as a whole reacts to this New Factor and absorbs of it as much as it possibly can. Then in Gemini, the youthful upstart feels its way out into the world —

senses, touches, smells, inquires into, pieces together, classifies and gives a name to everything. In this way, the concrete personality is born, in Cancer; and the growth of "human nature" as such ends.

In Leo, human nature finds a truly individualized and creative expression. The individual starts on his career and pursues it through the tests and disciplines of Virgo. He expands the scope of his character and destiny in Libra by acquiring a new depth, a new mind. He does so by meeting individuals as equals, by entering into real partnerships which subsist on a process of "give-and-take" in everything. In Scorpio, he learns not only to act as a partner, but to feel as a partner. He learns that out of the regular exchange taking place between equals in all relatively permanent partnership (be it in love or in business) a new sense of value is born. The group is more than the sum-total of the individuals in it. It becomes an entity, a synthesis which creates a "plus" element. Group values and group ideals are produced — these are social factors.

The social phase of the evolutionary cycle begins thus in Sagittarius as socializing impulses and ideas are released with great intensity, and often with notable fanaticism. In Capricorn, the Sagittarian zeal cools down; it becomes practical and very realistic.

The Prophet becomes a Pope; the social Pioneer, an Empire-builder.

With Aquarius, the surface strength of the social collectivity developed in the Earth sign Capricorn — in the group, the church, the nation or the empire — grows in depth. Society thinks itself; it finds for itself a meaning, a conscious purpose, and if need be, a justification. It perpetuates itself by building symbols of and monuments to its collective being — a society.

In Sagittarius society was seen as a vision, an ideal, an archetype.

Capricornians gave the vision substance while usually materializing it through political compromises. Aquarians are called upon to give civilization a Soul; or, if Capricornians made such a failure of their work that society became materialistic and superficial beyond hope of further development, Aquarians have the hard job of starting a process of social disintegration through revolutionary movements. In between the two alternatives, lies the still more arduous task of the Reformer, who fights against the crystallizing power of Capricorn, yet seeks to retain the valuable framework of organization which the great Capricornians had built.

Because many believe we are soon to enter the so-called Aquarian Age, all kinds of flamboyant things are said about Aquarius; partly also because the "people of the United States" are characterized as a whole in astrology by the sign Aquarius. But again we must repeat that everything depends on the level reached by the Aquarian. To have developed a strong "social" consciousness and to stand by (or even to create) "social" values is not of itself the proof of nobility or spirituality of character.

Indeed, at this time of world-crisis, the only really constructive task for the Aquarian is reform, or revolution. Whoever takes for granted the old patterns of our civilization will be left stranded on the drying shore of human society. Except where the society is of

recent origin, the spotlight belongs to individuals who are starting a new cycle and are in tune with the new creative impulse of human evolution. In the United States, a new foundation for society exists; but it has been overlaid with remains of the old European order. The task for leaders is thus essentially that of reform; but reform polarized to the new creative impulse of this and the next centuries

— not merely a return to eighteenth century patterns.

Aquarius is a sign of release of power. What has been

concentrated in Capricorn is released as creative power in Aquarius; or if Capricorn crystallized hopelessly the structure of the organism, Aquarius becomes a release of explosive power. Leo — the polar opposite — is individual creativeness which releases the power built in the home; or else it is the individual's folly and gambles which destroy the home. Aquarius is social creativeness or revolution.

However, the main personal problem for the Aquarian, psychologically speaking, is that of organizing his own private life on an individual basis. He is so eager to lose himself in some social movement, be it traditional or revolutionary, that he finds little strength for concentrating on his own inner development. Illness, thus, often comes to him as a blessing in disguise, forcing him to face himself and to introvert temporarily his energies. Aquarius is symbolized by the Water-Bearer releasing the waters of creative Spirit upon the earth; but there can be no significant release of these waters until the urn containing them is placed high on the man's shoulders. It is the individual's task to lift the urn filled with "living waters" up to his head.
