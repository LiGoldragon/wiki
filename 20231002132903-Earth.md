# Unsorted
Here are the implications of the *facts* which many *very daringly* deny , namely that there is absolutely no stellar parallax, that the gyroscope always remains level when tuned properly, and that land survey does not correct for "Earth curvature". The implications are that Earth is *level* and *motionless.* Did you know that water always find its level? Oceans are, without waves, completely flat. So is every piece of land ever surveyed, without terrain/features, completely flat. I know, I know! But nobody can explain any of this any better than "nobody has every experimentally or experientially , *ex* earthquakes, detected any Earth motion, and nobody has ever experimentally or experientially detected, *ex* terrain, any "Earth curvature", because time-space is "bent" by the "mass of Earth", even though we cannot experimentally or experientially demonstrate this theory."
