# Introduction
There is absolutely no stellar parallax, the gyroscope always remains level when tuned properly, and land survey does not correct for "Earth curvature". The implications are that Earth is physically *level* and *motionless.* Oceans are, without waves, completely flat. So is every piece of land ever surveyed, without terrain/features. The only refutation against these facts are that "nobody has every experimentally or experientially , *ex* earthquakes, detected any Earth motion, or, *ex* terrain, any "Earth curvature", because time-space is "bent" by the "mass of Earth." This refutation has never been experimentally or experientially demonstrated.
