## Hardcore privacy agreement (lacking)
An invitation to a matrix room is hereby described. The invite will be sent upon acceptance of the room's non-disclosure agreement. Acceptance or refusal is affected by replying to this message with 'The agreement is accepted by <InsertName>' or 'The agreement is refused by <InsertName>'. The acceptance must, to be valid, be posted while using a real-world photograph as the matrix account's avatar. The photograph must show nobody else and present a recent and clearly identifiable portrait of the person accepting the agreement.
The non-disclosure conditions are as follows:
Sharing any of, or informing of, _in any form_, any of the room's contents to non-members of the room, will result in a heavy _real lawsuit_ for damages for at least a thousand dollars[1], and in the most uncooperative case, in a death warrant/bounty. Remaining in the room may require accepting other conditions or amending the ones present here, which will be effective from the time of their acceptance.
[1]: One dollar is legally defined since the 19th century, as a little under 25 grains of gold. Accepted references, for weighing of payment, are Gold dollars and pre-war Gold Eagles.
