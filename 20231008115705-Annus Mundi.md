> Unfortunately, a lot of his material is mathematically in error, because 350 years (inaudible) ... he had trouble dating things on the Anno Domini and the Julian dating. What he didnt have any problem with was the unbroken, and very easy to calculate Annus Mundi (inaudible).
> He was able to date a great, massive destruction known to the ancient world as the Ogyg(ien?) deluge ... which was way after the Great Flood ... It started the Bronze Age ... he was able to date that precisely to the year 2208 Annus Mundi, not the 22 centure Annus Mundi ... very date-specic number.
