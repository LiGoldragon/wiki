## Online Classes
Welcome friends to the first in a series of online courses that I will be offering over the next few years, where we will be taking a compelling journey into the shamanic dreaming arts together. 

As we enter into this field of knowledge to cultivate our internal power & expand our resiliency, we will be exploring shamanic & energetic movement, breath work, unbinding practices, boundary development & shadow integration, along with many other dynamic art forms. 

This type of training will naturally induce new feelings & experiences with bodily awareness, lucid intensity, dreaming while awake & moving beyond the five senses, into the strengthening of our will.

Throughout our time together, we will be supported in the letting go of the conditioned outer storyline of fear, social limitation & attachment to outcome, as we curiously transition into accepting & receiving our own inner storytelling of intent, freedom & total authenticity. 

This powerfully liberating process will assist us in accessing more of our magical intuitive nature, making it possible for untapped resources within our being to be accessed and utilized.

The gratitude that comes from this type of discovery process has the power to transform our entire perspective and strengthen our relationship to source, so that we can be personally guided, directly, deeper into our abstract purpose.

There will possibly be some resistance at times, which is why being in a group setting is highly effective, as it naturally provides the support that can be helpful to navigate the depths of resetting our personal blueprint. 

This initial course is available to entry level & advanced students & we will be going slow and steady. For those that I have not yet worked with directly, we can utilize a free 30 minute discovery call to see if this is a good fit for you at this time. 

We will be connecting on zoom three times per month, on the third day of the week, for three hours per session, for three months. Cost is at a sliding scale rate of $321 to $123 per month. 

Please email me at fourdirections77@gmail.com to schedule a discovery call, sign up for the course, or to ask any questions. 

This journey of expansion & integration begins on 1/23 at 6pm Mountain time. 

I really look forward to connecting with those of you that are called to this type of adventuring & all that we will be learning from each other, along the way.
