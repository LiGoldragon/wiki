Austin has amazing insights, but he won't live long on tortured animal flesh; water has memory! Drink the Water of Shiva. The Damar Tantra is *very true*. Such a clever composer! Amazing line: Pluto in Aquarius wouldn't be complete without staring at the Heavens in terror. Very well done news analysis. Please, you are invited to book me on any astrology podcast! I found out about astrology when I saw the implications of the facts which many *very daringly* deny , namely that there is absolutely no stellar parallax, that the gyroscope always remains level when tuned properly, and that land survey does not correct for "Earth curvature". Did you know that water always find its level? Oceans are, without waves, completely flat. So is every piece of land ever surveyed, without terrain/features, completely flat. I know, I know! But nobody can explain any of this any better than "nobody has every experimentally or experientially , *ex* earthquakes, detected any Earth motion, and nobody has ever experimentally or experientially detected, *ex* terrain, any "Earth curvature", because time-space is "bent" by the "mass of Earth", even though we cannot experimentally or experientially demonstrate this theory."
